## Share Anywhere 

This was one of my first individual UX projects that I learned a lot from making. My goal for this project was to create an app for anyone who shares a passion for art and wants to bring awareness to their name. This app covers a wide range of talent, including video categories such as music, dancing, acting or art. During the pandemic and isolation, it must be difficult for people who wish to bring awareness to their artistic skills and only relying on variety of online platforms. However, I've introduced the possibility for those dedicated to art and want to share or watch this kind of content. 

### My Angle

My target audience for this project was for artistic users who wish to have their work shared online for the sole purpose of getting noticed. Or for those who wish to watch this content for entertainment. I find that this specific app can achieve these by specifically having content including music, dancing, acting or art that creators or viewers can have fun with as well as reach their desired goal.
