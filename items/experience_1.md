## Taking Karate classes

### What was it that you did?

I spent 8 years taking karate classes.

### When did you do it? 

I started in 2008 and stopped around 2017.

### What was good about it? 

It was a great learning experience and enjoyed doing it with my friend Selena.

### What was your favorite memory of it? 

My favorite memory was winning 1st place in a sparring Tournament. Sparring is fighting with protection gear on. 

### What didn't you enjoy about it? 

I did not enjoy the black belt test because it was 8-9 hours of consecutive exercise. As well as doing absolutely everything we've learned since white belt which was challenging.
