## Multifunctional Desk Organizer

This was one of my group projects this year that was a lot of fun to collaborate and create. The goal our group had was to "hack" the function of a regular corrugated cardboard box and make a functional product out of it. In conclusion, our group decided to create a desk organizer with three different compartments. The three compartments include a organizer insert for pens, pencils or any other stationary needs, a holding box for books, notebooks and paper, and lastly a cable holder for keeping all the users wires and cords untangled. All of these sections are detachable and can function independently so the organizer can meet any user's needs and adjust it to their liking.

### My Angle
My target audience for this product is mainly students who wish to keep their desk as organized as possible. This can help university students who wish to keep their space organized by adjusting the desk organizer to their preferred liking. Whether users want to use only one of the compartments on their own or all of them.
