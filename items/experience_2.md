## ShopForYou 

This is another one of my first group UX projects during my first year. Our goal as a team was to create a shopping app that makes it easier for customers to buy products from everywhere. Customers will be able to find and compare products through the app and finalize their purchase to their liking. During the pandemic, it must be hard to transition from going to different shopping malls to stuck at home with limited protocols. With the ShopForYou app, we created it with the intention of having every store that sells online to be on one platform to limit confusion for users and helping them find the right product. The image below shows the business applications, more specifically our income statement, for our pitch and our expenses overall when conducting this application.

### My Angle
My target audience for my project was for online shoppers specifically to use a singular platform for all their wanted findings. This may help elderly people who wish to online shop however don't have as much knowledge as to where to look to online shop. During the pandemic, this can help users achieve this goal by lessening the search for these online platforms and just using one singular platform or app to find what they want easier.
