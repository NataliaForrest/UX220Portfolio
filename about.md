### About


I am 20 years old and studying to be a User Experience Designer. I am in my second year at Wilfrid Laurier university in Brantford and plan to do co-op this upcoming year. My goal is to be in co-op by the end of next semester and to practice coding to get significantly better at it and more knowledgeable.
